I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), co-advised by [Dr. Thinh Doan](https://coolautonomylab.github.io/members/thinh.html) and [Dr. Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu). I obtained my Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the National University of Singapore, under the supervision of [Dr. Guillaume Adrien Sartoretti](https://www.marmotlab.org/bio.html). Additionally, I am a visiting scholar at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu), working under Professor [Shaoping Xiao](https://engineering.uiowa.edu/directory/shaoping-xiao). I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Engineering Mechanics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning and Robotics, with a recent focus on developing robotic generalist policies. My long-term goal is to enable agents and robots to efficiently solve complex, diverse tasks in real-world applications.

Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in discussing relevant research topics or exploring potential collaborations.
