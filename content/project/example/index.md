title: Enhancing Multi-task Generalization in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
summary: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving multi-task generalization to diverse agents and objectives presents significant challenges. Existing online MARL algorithms primarily focus on single-task performance, but their lack of multi-task generalization capabilities typically results in substantial computational waste and limited real-life applicability. Meanwhile, existing offline multi-task MARL approaches are heavily dependent on data quality, often resulting in poor performance on unseen tasks. Therefore, we want to develop effective Multi-task MARL methods that can achieve generalization across different tasks with little training costs.
