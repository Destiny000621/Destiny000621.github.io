title: Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Solving Multiple Tasks
summary: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained significant attention for its potential to solve complex problems in areas such as robotics, sensor networks, and gaming. However, most recent RL approaches focus primarily on learning policies for a single task in simulated environments. This focus can create substantial challenges when transitioning to real-world applications, as the high costs and risks associated with interactions under partially learned policies can be prohibitive. Consequently, enabling agents to solve multiple tasks within a single training process is crucial for the practical deployment of RL in real-world scenarios.
