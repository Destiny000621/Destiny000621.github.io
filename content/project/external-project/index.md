title: Explicit Coordination with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Skills in Multi-Agent Systems
summary: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) presents unique challenges, notably credit assignment and non-stationarity, complicating the learning process in comparison to Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Directly developing an effective cooperative policy through decentralized learning, which depends exclusively on the knowledge and memory of individual agents, poses significant difficulties, and in some cases, may be unfeasible. Skill discovery may be a possible solution. Besides, incorporating global/local communication among agents or agent teams offers a potential resolution to these challenges. This approach enables agents to exchange information and intentions while preserving scalability. Consequently, it mitigates issues related to partial observability and non-stationarity, and enhances joint collaboration at the team level. In essence, communication empowers dispersed agents to operate cohesively as a unified group, rather than merely as an assembly of independent entities.
